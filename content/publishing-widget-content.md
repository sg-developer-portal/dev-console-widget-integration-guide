# Publishing Widget Content

After you have integrated the Console Widget into your application, you might want to publish content related to your team's product(s) in the widget itself for others to see. 

This is not part of the technical integration per se but it is an optional next step that if relevant, you might want to explore.

To find out more about how to publish content regarding your products on the Console Widget check out this [repo](https://github.com/GovTechSG/dev-console-products-info) for more information and join the [telegram channel](https://t.me/+k87OuBm9MARkYjk1) to ask any questions.

<!-- Once you are ready to publish, simply fill out this [form]() and we will get back to you on the onboarding process. -->
