# Testing

## Testing Widget
We are using [web test runner](https://modern-web.dev/docs/test-runner/overview/) with the help of [open-wc/testing](https://open-wc.org/docs/testing/testing-package/) package to do integration and unit tests. Open-wc/testing is an opinionated package that accumulated different useful testing packages from different testing frameworks such as chai and mocha.

Web test runner launches a browser environment to run the tests on and have the capabilities to run tests for chromium, firefox and webkit based browsers.Â 

We have no tests to cover IE11.

## Testing CDK Infra

Since we are using AWS CDK which is infra as code, we are able to test it using the [assertion module](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/assertions-readme.html).

Tests are ran against the Cloudformation template that gets generated by the CDK.

## Testing Lambda Functions

Using mocha with sinon mocking library.
